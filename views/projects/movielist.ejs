        With MovieList, I got to combine my love of coding with my extreme passion for visual media and 
        cataloguing. MovieList is a movie indexing application which allows users to search for their 
        favorite movies or movies they’ve seen, add them to a list, rate them, and sort through their 
        collection in a variety of ways.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While there are a variety of other movie cataloguing sites out there, they place hardly any emphasis 
        on user ratings and user information. With MovieList, the user’s average rating is displayed on their 
        profile page and they can compare their own individual movie ratings against the aggregated opinions 
        of sites such as IMDB, Metacritic, and Rotten Tomatoes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My long term goal for the project would be to eventually pivot away from the current OMDB API in 
        favor of a more consistent and detailed movie database in order to better display movie details and 
        extrapolate engaging viewer information.
