        Punch Card is a proof-of-concept app that aims to digitize the rewards card experience for both users 
        and restaurants. While many companies and restaurants have digitized reward systems themselves, the 
        spirit of Punch Card was to provide opportunities to restaurants with lower tech capability. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Punch Card was built using React and was a 4-person collaboration between myself and fellow developers 
        Scott Ammon, Jacob Spade, and Matt Carver. My role on the team was writing the backend for the 
        application, handling the database, integrating the data into React, and managing each componentâ€™s 
        state along with Scott. The rest of the team was responsible for styling and component-creation. 
        <br />
        <br />
        In its current state, Punch Card allows a user to select from a handful of hardcoded restaurant 
        options and add the punch cards they would like to make use of to their account. The paradigm used 
        was that, after making a purchase, the user would be given a reward code which is specific to that 
        restaurant and hashed on the back-end. They can receive a punch towards their reward by entering a 
        valid reward code.
