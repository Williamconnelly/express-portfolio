        Danmaku is a fast-paced, arcade shooter where the player controls a single ship and attempts to 
        outmaneuver enemy fire while using their own projectiles to defeat them and achieve a progressively 
        higher score. The name of the game stems from a direct homage to the genre it attempts to emulate - 
        (弾幕) - which translates to “barrage”. 
      <br />
      <br />
        The general aspiration behind Danmaku’s creation was that I wanted to make a game that was both 
        frenetic and one which relied upon the user’s precise inputs to determine their success and failure. 
        Thus I arrived at the arcade-shooter as my genre of choice, a game-design that allows for very little 
        error but also for a player’s absolute freedom in how they decide to move upon each axis, the order in 
        which they dispatch their opponents, and how they time each action. 
      <br />
      <br />
        One point of intrigue is that the entire game is accomplished through simple DOM manipulation
        done through jQuery. The game runs on a loop of 60 frames a second and compares the state of the DOM to 
        ever-changing input-variables in order to update the game's display roughly every 17 milliseconds. 
        Initially this expensive process of updating everything active in the game screen at once proved to be
        too much however after switching to a more object-oriented paradigm, the game updates quite smoothly. 
        Though admittedly an afterthought, Danmaku also supports two-player co-op which can be toggled on or 
        off when first starting the game.
