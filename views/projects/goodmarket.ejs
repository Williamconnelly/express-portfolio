        Good Market is a charity-focused, user-centric, e-commerce site where users can either purchase 
        items they want or sell to other people. When posting an item to the marketplace, a seller determines 
        what percentage of their transaction should go to a supported charity of their choosing. Good Market 
        was built by myself along with two other developers, Kacy Sommers and Jacob Spade.
        <br />
        <br />
        My role in the development of the site was multi-faceted, however my most notable code contributions 
        were the creation, styling, and back-end integration of the user’s checkout cart, the sign-in pages, 
        and the charity listing. I also tackled the most challenging aspect of the site alongside fellow 
        developer Kacy Sommers, the integration of the Stripe API, which is what allows users to enter their 
        card information and create transactions between one another. I also took a central role in managing a 
        lot of the project’s workflow.

        <span>NOTE: Good Market is running it’s transactions through Stripe in TEST MODE.</span> No money will be 
        extracted from or added to your account, though the site fully simulates the actual process. 
        Before posting items for sale or purchasing the items in their cart, a user must first complete 
        their account registration. Good Market’s user flow looks something like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A user can openly browse the marketplace, the list of supported charities, and user profiles 
              without needing an account themselves.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If a user creates an account and sets up their profile, they are then able to post items to 
            the marketplace and determine how much of each sale they want to forward to charity. They can 
            also now complete purchases. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once they have entered their payment information, both the buyer and sellers will receive an 
            e-mail notification of the transaction and a buyer will be given the opportunity to leave a 
            comment or review on the sellers’ profiles.</p>
        </li>
